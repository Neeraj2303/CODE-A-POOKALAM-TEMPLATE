# 🌸 Code-a-Pookkalam 🌸

Pookkalam is a timeless tradition of Onam — colorful floral patterns that bring people together in creativity and joy.
But this time, I'm mixing tradition with tech. Instead of petals, I'm using pixels. Instead of flowers, I'm using code.

It’s a fun activity where you design your own digital pookkalam using **HTML + CSS**.
Don’t worry if you’re not a pro at design — this is all about experimenting, learning, and creating something unique.
